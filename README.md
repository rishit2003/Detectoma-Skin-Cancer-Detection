# Detectoma: Skin Cancer Detection App

**Detectoma** is an Android-based solution to assist in the early detection and monitoring of potential skin cancers (e.g., melanoma). It integrates both **hardware** (ESP32 microcontrollers) and **software** (Android app with Firebase and TensorFlow Lite) to collect patient data, capture and analyze images of moles, and generate insights for users and healthcare providers.

## Overview

Modern health applications can leverage computer vision and machine learning for early intervention. **Detectoma** provides:

- **Android-based patient interface** where users can record mole observations, answer a short ABCDE questionnaire, and capture images via a specialized ESP32 camera.
- **Thermal and distance measurements** using a second ESP32 with sensors, helping monitor mole growth and temperature variations.
- **Cloud integration with Firebase** for secure data storage and real-time updates.
- **On-device machine learning** using TensorFlow Lite to classify suspicious lesions and produce a heatmap overlay for visual inspection.

The primary goal is not to replace medical advice but to assist patients and doctors in early detection and monitoring.

1. **ESP32 Camera**: Takes pictures, saves them to Firebase Storage.
2. **ESP32 Sensors**: Reads temperature & distance, stores results in Firebase Realtime Database.
3. **Android App**: Fetches images from Storage, merges sensor data from RTDB, runs inference, and displays results with an ABCDE-based questionnaire.
4. **Healthcare Provider**: Can link to patient accounts, view data, and unlink when necessary.
