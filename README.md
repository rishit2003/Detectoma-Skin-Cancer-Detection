# Elec390-Coen390

This is our 390 mini capstone project. We plan on creating a skin cancer detecting app created for healthcare providers in rural communities.

Our data set is from an older kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/siim-isic-melanoma-classification
We have access to this through both kaggle and an IEEE member.

Our idea: We want to create an app that detects skin cancers (mainly melanoma), using an app and an external sensor kit. The app will be used to input the users meta data such as age and sex, wheras the sensor kit for now will be used to take a high quality photo of the patients skin and a temperature reader to check for a fever.
