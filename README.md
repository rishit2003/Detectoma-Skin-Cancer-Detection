# Elec390-Coen390

This is our 390 mini capstone project. We plan on creating a skin cancer detecting app created for healthcare providers in rural communities.

Our data set is from an older kaggle competition: https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/siim-isic-melanoma-classification
We have access to this through both kaggle and an IEEE member.
